    <h2>Sunny Leaf Homes</h2>

    <p>
      My design uses encapsulation because there is minimal text, which will get
      user to the point of the site faster, which would be signing up for the newsletter. My design has contrast
      because I used a colorful picture and used darker colours to convey the information across. I offer a demo
      on my mock-up to the users. If they sing up for the newsletter then they will be able to visit the open
      house. To make negative space I used one image for the background and black texts so the site didn't look too busy.
