    <h1>Vancouver Shinpo</h1>
    <h2>Website</h2>
    <p>
      This is the design I have created for Vancouver Shinpo. The transparent nav-bar wll stay at the top of the screen as you are scrolling down and there are drop down menu's when hovered over to show more options.
      The first thing users will see as they scroll on the site are the top stories for that day/week. Underneath the top stories are story's that are trending that are displayed in the click through or slideshow gallery.

    <h2>Mobile Website</h2>
    <p>
      For the mobile website, I wanted to keep the design similar to the main website. There is a transparent navigation at the top with a hamburger menu where users will find all their menu options.
      The first thing you see is the top stories and at the bottom of the page there are trending topics that are shown in a gallery.
