  <h2>About the Design</h2>
  <p>
    This is the design I have created for Shinpo. The transparent nav-bar wll stay at the top of the screen as you are scrolling down and there are drop down menu's when hovered over to show more options.
    The first thing users will see as they scroll on the site are the top stories for that day/week. Underneath the top stories are story's that are trending that are displayed in the click through or slideshow gallery.
